# 2. Load seed data
npm run seed:songs

# 3. Run tests (in another terminal)
npm test
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Quick test after changes
npm run test:songs

# Full regression test
npm test
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Tests return exit code 0 (success) or 1 (failure)
npm test && echo "All good!" || echo "Tests failed!"
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **`backend/TESTING.md`** - Main testing guide
- **`backend/tests/README.md`** - Complete test documentation
- **`backend/tests/QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference guide

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Base URL
Edit `tests/test-helpers.sh`:
```bash
BASE_URL="http://localhost:5001/api"  # Change port if needed
```

### Add New Tests
1. Edit appropriate test file (e.g., `test-songs.sh`)
2. Use helper functions: `api_get`, `api_post`, `api_delete`
3. Follow existing patterns

Example:
```bash
print_test "GET /songs/new-endpoint - Description"
api_get "/songs/new-endpoint" "Description" 200
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Run Tests in Order** - Auth tests must run first (they create user)
2. **Check Server Logs** - Backend logs provide detailed error info
3. **Use Seed Data** - Load `seed:songs` for consistent test data
4. **Manual Verification** - Auth tests require email verification code
5. **Fresh Start** - Clear database between full test runs if needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
